                    <h3>When you can make a housing disrepair claim?</h3>
                    <p>If your landlord refuses to make repairs to your property that they are responsible for then you may be able to make a claim against them.</p>
                    <p>To be eligible to make a claim you must have informed your landlord about the disrepair, you will need to provide evidence and we can assist you with this process. If your landlord has failed to make a repair within reasonable time limits then you can claim against them.</p>
                    <p>Housing disrepair claims can be made either during your tenancy or after your tenancy, however, you must make the claim within 6 years of the date that you provided notice to your landlord about the disrepair. Personal injury claims must be made within 3 years of received notice.</p>
                    <p>Itâ€™s important to note that your landlord may not be responsible for repairs including repair faults if they are a result of you either not taking care of the property properly or doing something unreasonable. We currently do not accept private landlord claims, as a rule of thumb if you have used a letting agent or your landlord is an individual we may not be able to assist you.</p>
