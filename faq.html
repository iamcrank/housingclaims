                        <p>Making a claim is easy. Request a call back from one of our dedicated housing team members. We will assess your claim and write to your landlord on your behalf. Then we will instruct a surveyor to attend your property and assess how much the repairs will cost.
                            Your Landlord will be asked to carry out the repairs as calculated by our surveyor. If they fail to do so, we will issue court proceedings against them and force them to carry out the repairs you’re owed.</p>

                        <p>We aim to get your repairs carried out and to obtain monetary compensation for you. We will ensure your landlord carries out the repairs to a high standard. We will also seek compensation for your loss of enjoyment. The amount of compensation you get depends on the length of time you have had to live in the property in a poor state. For your claim to be successful, you must have complained to the landlord about the ongoing problems.</p>

                        <p>Legally, if you are a tenant of a housing association or council house, your landlord CANNOT EVICT YOU for starting a housing claim. However, the only exception to this is if you are in arrears AND do not have a payment plan in place. If you are in arrears, you should ensure you have a payment plan in place; even £1 a month is sufficient to protect you.</p>
                        <p>For those who rent private, the law is different and the landlord can serve a section 21 eviction notice. There are campaigns to end this. At the moment we do not undertake private landlord work.</p>

                        <p>No! Your housing claim with us is on a "No win, no fee" basis. The agreement between us is called a Conditional Fee Agreement, the document is prepared by the Law Society and is filled with legal jargon. BUT don't be put off by it. You just don't need to worry when you are making a no-win, no fee claim. We will explain all the requirements. We will bear all of the upfront costs, and you will only pay a fee from your damages if the claim is successful. This 'success fee' will only be deducted from your compensation at the end of the case.</p>
