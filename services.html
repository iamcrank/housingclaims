            <h2>Common Housing Disrepair Issues In Social And Council Housing.</h2>
            <div class="listcontainer">
                <div class="box">
                    <h4>RODENT AND PEST INFESTATION</h4>
                    <p>Has your landlord’s failure to uphold the structural integrity of your home forced you to start living with unwelcome guests? If disrepair in your home has caused you so much infestation, you can claim compensation through a housing disrepair association or contact our team of specialist solicitors to investigate your claim.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h4>STRUCTURAL DEFECT TO THE PROPERTY</h4>
                    <p>Structural issues can be ticking time bombs as they often represent the root cause of other problems in a property, many of which can result in disrepair claims. For instance, broken stairs and rails, broken ceilings or roof, cracked walls, rotten window or door frames, severely cracked wall plaster and loose tiles etc.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box">
                    <h4> FLOODING AND WATER LEAKS</h4>
                    <p>Are you experiencing persistent flooding and water leaks? Flooding and water leaks expose you to health and safety risks and ultimately lead to disrepair claims. Water damage is a serious issue in any apartment and must be addressed quickly to prevent it from entering into your property and damaging your belongings or even causing damps.</p>

                    <h4>DAMP OR MOULD ISSUES</h4>
                    <p>Many housing disrepair cases are due to failure on the part of the landlord to deal with damp and mould. When a disrepair in your house caused by water from outside affects the entire structure of the building it can result in mould and penetrating damps if not addressed on time. Damp and mould can expose tenants to  serious health issues and make the environment unsafe to live in.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    <h4>BOILERS AND ELECTRICS</h4>
                    <p>Many landlords fail when it comes to ensuring the heating system in the home is in optimum condition. Faulty electrics are hazardous to live with and should be repaired to avoid fire disaster. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The windows, roof, drains and gutters are crucial to your health and safety in a rented home. It is the responsibility of your landlord to maintain these structures.</p>

                <h3>What are landlords responsible for?</h3>
                <p>As part of their duty to ensure that your property is safe and liveable, landlords are always responsible for repairs in a reasonable period of time to the following:</p>
                <p>
                    Your property’s structure and exterior, such as the roof, walls and windows <br>
                    Sanitary fittings such as baths, sinks and basins, this also includes <br>
                     Pipes and drains <br>
                    Heating and water systems <br>
                    Gas appliances <br>
                    Ventilation <br>
                    Electrical wiring 
                </p>
                <p>Your landlord cannot charge you for any of the repair work listed above and they are responsible for these repairs irrespective of what your tenancy agreement says. However, if your landlord agrees they may also be responsible for additional repairs too, this depends on your tenancy agreement.</p>
